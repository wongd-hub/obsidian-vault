## Introduction

- JavaScript was designed to be flexible and easy to use for small applications. However, this makes the language less ideal for building larger applications.
- Stricter programming languages will inform the developer whenever a change in one area of code will break other areas. This doesn't happen in JavaScript, leading to confusing issues at runtime.

- Microsoft developed TypeScript in 2012 as a way of blending the flexibility of JavaScript with stricter languages (i.e. it is strongly typed).
  - TypeScript adds types to JavaScript allowing us to clarify the structure of and help refactor our code if need be.
  - In addition, TypeScript adds arrow functions and classes to the language years before they were added to JavaScript.
