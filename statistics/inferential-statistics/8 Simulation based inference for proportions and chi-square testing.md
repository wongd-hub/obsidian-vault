## Small sample proportions

If the success-failure â‰¥ 10 rule (i.e. the Sample Size/Skew condition) is not satisfied, then the sampling distribution for your given scenario will not adhere to the CLT, reducing the effectiveness of CLT-based methods.

Here, we turn to simulation-based methods such as bootstrapping.

**Example**

Paul the Octopus once picked the winner of all 8 World Cup games in a year correctly. The 'experiment' design was to give Paul the choice of eating out of one box or another, where each box represented the flag of the competing teams that day.

Our hypothesis test will aim to determine whether Paul is psychic, or if he picked all games right just by chance.

$$H_0: p = 0.5, H_A: p > 0.5, n = 8, \hat{p} = 1$$

Checking to see if the conditions for CLT inference are met:

- Independence
	- We can assume that Paul's picks each day are independent from each other for now

- Sample Size/Skew
	- $0.5 \times 8 = 4$ which does not meet this condition.

Hence, CLT assumptions are not met and so CLT-based methods do not apply here. Instead, let's use simulation-based methods.

- The p-value for this hypothesis test is $P(\text{observed or more extreme outcome}\space|\space H_0 \text{ is true}) \Rightarrow P(\hat{p} \ge 1.0 \space|\space p = 0.5)$

- So what we must do is devise a simulation scheme that can replicate Paul's trials, and perform these simulations under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true

- Repeat this simulation N times, recording the relevant sample statistic each time

- Calculate the p-value as the proportion of simulations that yielded sample statistics that were favourable to the alternative hypothesis

To do this, we must simulate Paul's trials. Since he is picking between two boxes, with an assumed null probability of 50% chance for each box, we can approximate these trials by flipping a coin 8 times per simulation (flipping a coin is used as an example since it is conceptually equivalent to Paul's trial, no other significance here).

Below we:

- Flip a coin 8 times each simulation, naming 'heads' a success and binding this to 1 (and tails to 0)

- The proportion of heads in each 8 flips is then $\hat{p}_i$, for the $i$th simulation; we repeat this N = 100,000 times

- These 100,000 $\hat{p}_i$s form the sampling/bootstrap distribution, see the histogram of results below

- The p-value for this test will then be $P(\hat{p} \ge 1.0 \space|\space p = 0.5) \Rightarrow \frac{\text{num. simulations where }\hat{p} \ge 1}{N} \approx 0.00390$

```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(dplyr));
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))

options(repr.plot.width = 15, repr.plot.height = 7)

simulate_binary <- function(N, n = 8) {

	results <- vector('double', N)
	
	sapply(
		results,
		function(z) sample(c(0, 1), n, replace = T) |> mean()
	)
	
}

results <- simulate_binary(100000)

tibble(p_hat = results) |
	ggplot(aes(x = p_hat)) +
	geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
	labs(
		title = 'Simulated p-hat for this experiment',
		y = 'Count',
		x = 'Simulated p-hat'
	) +
	scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
	scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```

```r
scales::percent(
	Filter(function(x) {x >= 1}, results) |> length() / length(results), 
		accuracy = 0.001
)
#> '0.390%'
```

This is under the 5% significance level, hence we reject the null hypothesis as there is strong evidence for the alternative. Does this really mean that Paul is psychic? Probably not. We're likely making a Type I error here or possibly asking the wrong question.

## Examples

Suppose we recruit 12 volunteers to test the validity of the idiom "to know it like the back of one's hand". Each volunteer is shown 10 pictures of gloved hands and must correctly choose which picture contains their hand. Say 11 of 12 people complete this task successfully - is this sufficiently strong evidence that people truly know the backs of their hands?

$$H_0: \text{volunteers are no better than randomly guessing, ie }p = \frac{1}{10}; H_A: p > \frac{1}{10}$$

To devise a simulation scheme that is suitable for this experiment, we note that if the volunteers were truly randomly guessing then their true chance of picking their hand correctly is 0.1.

- We can roll a 10-sided fair die to represent the sampling space, calling '1' a success (recognising one's own hand) and all other outcomes a failure

- For each simulation ($i$), we roll the die 12 times (to represent the 12 original volunteers), calculating $\hat{p}_i$ each time.

- Run the simulation 100 times, creating a bootstrap distribution, then finding the proportion of simulations where the proportion is equal to or more extreme than the observed point estimate: $11/12 \approx 0.9167$.

Performing this in a similar manner to the simulation demo shown previously, we get a p-value of very close to 0 and hence we reject the null hypothesis. There is strong evidence that the volunteers are better than just randomly guessing which of the 10 pictures was their own hand.

## Comparing two small sample proportions

Suppose we extend the experiment we performed in the previous example to also test whether volunteers can recognise the palm side of their hands. We get the following results:

| Outcome | Back | Palm | Total |
| :- | -: | -: | -: |
| Correct | 11 | 7 | 18 |
| Incorrect | 1 | 5 | 6 |
| Total | 12 | 12 | 24 |
| $\hat{p}$ | 0.9167 | 0.5833 | 0.7500 |

Do these data provide sufficient evidence that there is a difference in how good individuals are at recognising the backs of their hands vs. recognising the palm of their hands?

$H_0: p_{back} - p_{palm} = 0, H_A: p_{back} - p_{palm} \neq 0$

Checking assumptions

- Independence
	- Within groups: we can assume that the guess of each volunteer is independent from the other volunteers' guesses
	- Between groups: we have the same volunteers guessing across two tests - this is in fact a paired structure. For the purposes of illustration we will continue with this example though.

- Sample Size/Skew
	- Since we're comparing between two population proportions here, we need to calculate number of successes and failures using the pooled proportion. $\hat{p}_{pool}$ is calculated in the table above as 0.75.
	- $12 \times 0.75 = 9$, and $12 \times 0.25 = 3$; neither of these meet the standard of 10, so CLT assumptions are not met - use simulation methods

Simulation scheme - the same principles as before apply, apart from the need to use the pooled proportion in this scheme

- Set up 24 index cards - each representing a volunteer and their two guesses across the two tests

- Using the pooled proportion - mark 18 cards as 'correct' and 6 cards as 'incorrect'; note that this is done *before* apportioning the cards into the two groups

- Apportion the 24 cards into two groups of 12 cards, representing back and palm tests

- Calculate the difference in proportion between correctness in back and palm test groups. Resimulate many times, each difference in proportion is another entry in your bootstrap distribution

Once your bootstrap distribution is constructed

- The point estimate of the difference is ~33% ($0.9167 - 0.5833$), so we want to find the proportion of simulations where $|\hat{p}| > 0.33$

- This comes out to around 16%, so we would fail to reject the null hypothesis and we say there isn't strong evidence to suggest that there is a difference between people recognising the palm of their hand vs. the back of it.

```r
simulate_mythbusters <- function(
	N, n = 12, 
	sample_space = c(rep(1, 18), rep(0, 6))
) {

	results <- vector('double', N)
	
	sapply(
		results,
		function(x) {
		
			idx <- sample(1:(2*n), n, replace = F)
		
			p_hat_back <- sample_space[idx] |> mean()
			p_hat_palm <- sample_space[-idx] |> mean()
			
			p_hat_back - p_hat_palm
		
		}
	)
}

results_mb <- simulate_mythbusters(100000)

tibble(p_hat_diff = results_mb) |>
	ggplot(aes(x = p_hat_diff)) +
	geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
	labs(
		title = 'Simulated p-hat difference between back and palms for this experiment',
		y = 'Count',
		x = 'Simulated p-hat(back) - p-hat(palm)'
	) +
	scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
	scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent)
```
![[Pasted image 20230712230444.png]]
```r
point_est_diff <- 0.9167 - 0.5833 

scales::percent( 
	Filter(function(x) {abs(x) >= point_est_diff}, results_mb) |> length() / length(results_mb), 
	accuracy = 0.001 
)
#> '1.397%'
```

This is below the significance level so we can say we have strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis that there is indeed a difference in people's ability to pick out the back of their hand vs. their palm.

*Note: the course quotes a p-value of 15.66; unclear why this is so high and far off the value we get as they seem to do a substantial number of simulations as well*

## Chi-Square GOF test

Suppose the court of a small county is being accused of racial discrimination, with the claim being that the jury is not being picked in line with the ethnicity seen in the population of the county. See below the true proportion of each ethnicity within the county, as well as the number of individuals from each ethnicity seen in the jury. The expected row is the true population proportion multipled by 2500 which is the number of jurors picked.

| Population | White | Black | Native American | Asian | Other | Total |
| :- | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| Census | 80.29% | 12.06% | 0.79% | 2.92% | 3.94% | 100% |
| Jury | 1920 | 347 | 19 | 84 | 130 | 100% |
| # Expected | 2007 | 302 | 20 | 73 | 98 | 2500 |

Based on hypothesis testing principles, our null hypothesis would be that there is nothing going on (i.e. the distribution of jurors matches the distribution of the population); whereas our alternative hypothesis would be that the distributions are not the same.

Here we want to be able to quantify how different the observed counts are from the expected counts, large differences from the expected counts provide evidence to the alternative hypothesis

- This is called a goodness-of-fit (GOF) test since we're evaluating how well the observed distribution *fits* to the expected distribution.
- The name of this test is the Chi-Square ($\chi^2$) test

The conditions for the $\chi^2$ test are as follows, and it appears that our example meets them

- Independence: observations must be independent
	- Randomly sampled/assigned observations
	- If sampling without replacement, n â‰¤ 10% of the population
	- Each observation is only in one cell in the table (e.g. we cannot mark someone as both Asian and White)

- Sample Size
	- Each level must have at least 5 expected cases

Let's work towards the $\chi^2$ test statistic. A test statistic:

- Generally takes the form of $\frac{\text{point estimate } - \text{ null value}}{\text{SE of point estimate}}$, and in doing so:
	- Identifies the difference between the observed point estimate and the expected value if the null hypothesis were true
	- Standardises the difference using the standard error of the point estimate

- The $\chi^2$ statistic is helpful when dealing with counts and investigating how far observed counts are from expected counts:
	- Why square? We do not want positive and negative differences cancelling each other out. We could also use the absolute value of the difference, however, squaring will exacerbate unusual differences which is an ideal trait for our use-case.
	- The $\chi^2$ distribution has one parameter, the degrees of freedom, which influences the shape, center, and spread of the distribution. It is calculated as $k - 1$.

$$\chi^2 = \sum^k_{i=1}\frac{(O - E)^2}{E}$$

Where $O$ is the observed count, $E$ is the expected count, and $k$ is the number of levels of the category (5 in our case). See a visualisation of the distribution below:

![[Pasted image 20230712231205.png]]

**Putting it all together into our hypothesis test**

- $H_0:$ The observed count of jurors from various races/ethnicities follow the same distribution as in the population

- $H_A:$ The observed count of jurors from various races/ethnicities *do not* follow the same distribution as in the population

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(1920 - 2007)^2}{2007} + \dots + \frac{(130 - 98)^2}{98} = 22.63$$

$$df = k - 1 = 5 - 1 = 4$$

- The p-value for a $\chi^2$ test is defined as the tail area above the calculated test statistic. Similarly to F-distributions, we are only interested in the right-side of the distribution as we are dealing with magnitude of difference here.

```r
pchisq(22.63, 4, lower.tail = FALSE)
#> 0.000150104030373803
```

Since this p-value is below the significance level of 5%, we can reject the null hypothesis, citing strong evidence for the alternative hypothesis which is that there is a difference in distribution between the jury ethnicity distribution and the population one.

## Chi-Square independence test

We now turn our attention to cases where we have two categorical variables, with at least one having more than two levels. See below the results of a study that enumerated sampled individuals as obese/not obese and their dating status. Does there appear to be a relationship between weight and dating status?

| Outcome | Dating | Cohabiting | Married | Total |
| :- | -: | -: | -: | -: |
| Obese | 81 | 103 | 147 | 331 |
| Not obese | 359 | 326 | 277 | 962 |
| Total | 440 | 429 | 424 | 1293 |

As usual, we set our hypotheses:

- $H_0:$ there is nothing going on - weight and relationship status are independent
- $H_A:$ weight and relationship status are dependent, i.e. obesity rates vary by dating status

To evaluate these hypotheses, we again need a way of quantifying how different the observed counts are from the expected counts.

- This test is called a test of independence since we're evaluating the relationship between two variables
- We calculate the $\chi^2$ statistic in the exact same way as before, with one difference
	- Degrees of freedom are calculated as $(R - 1) \times (C - 1)$, where $R$ is the number of rows and $C$ is the number of columns - same thing as counting the levels of each categorical variable, minusing one from each, then multiplying together
- Conditions for validity for this tests are the exact same as the $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit test

So the $\chi^2$ statistic is calculated in the same way as in the goodness-of-fit test, however we need to figure out what our expected counts in each cell should be; this can be generalised as:

$$\text{expected count} = \frac{(\text{row total}) \times (\text{column total})}{\text{table total}}$$

Looping back a little bit, what we're essentially doing with the above equation is:

- Determining what the overall obesity rate is within the sample (so regardless of relationship status)
- Determining, based on the count of people in each relationship status, what the expected number of obese people is using the rate determined previously - this is the expected number of individuals in each relationship status if obesity were independent from it.

Using the equation and principles above, the expected counts are as follows:

| Outcome | Dating | Cohabiting | Married |
| :- | -: | -: | -: |
| Obese | 113 | 110 | 108 |
| Not obese | 327 | 319 | 316 |

We can now calculate our $\chi^2$ statistic - this is done over the 6 cells shown above:

$$\chi^2 = \frac{(81 - 113)^2}{113} + \frac{(103 - 110)^2}{110} + \dots + \frac{(326 - 319)^2}{319} + \frac{(277 - 316)^2}{316} = 31.68$$

$$df = (2 - 1) \times (3 - 1) = 2$$

```r
pchisq(31.68, 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
#> 1.32061250902013e-07
```

This is below our significance level of 5%, hence we reject the null hypothesis and conclude there is strong evidence that weight and relationship status are dependent.

Note that since this is an observational study, we cannot infer any causal relationships between these variables - we can only make statements about the dependence of these variables. Along with this we need to consider the effect of possible confounders, for example, age is a variable that might cause this relationship to look different.

**To summarise**

We have looked at $\chi^2$ tests in two contexts:

- goodness-of-fit: comparing the distribution of one categorical variable (with more than two levels) against a hypothesised distribution
- independence: evaluating the relationship between two categorical variables (at least one with more than two levels)
