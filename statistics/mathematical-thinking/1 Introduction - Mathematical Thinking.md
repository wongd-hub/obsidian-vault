#course_coursera-intro-maths-thinking 

## Introductory lecture

- Mathematical thinking is a powerful way of thinking that has been developed over 3,000 years.
- You won't learn any mathematics techniques in this course; this is about the thinking involved.
- The transition to pure, abstract math is often difficult. Before this, the focus is on memorising procedures & thinking inside the box. 
  - If you got good at this, you likely got good at recognising certain kinds of problems and knowing how to address them. This course is about how to address problems that don't fit templates you're familiar with - and how to think them through.

- Key steps:
  1. Stop looking for a formula to apply or a procedure to follow
  2. Figure out what the problem *actually* says, not the form of the problem. Focus on understanding, not doing.
