#course_coursera-intro-maths-thinking 

## Introductory lecture

- Mathematical thinking is a powerful way of thinking that has been developed over 3,000 years.
- You won't learn any mathematics techniques in this course; this is about the thinking involved.
- The transition to pure, abstract math is often difficult. Before this, the focus is on memorising procedures & thinking inside the box. 
    - If you got good at this, you likely got good at recognising certain kinds of problems and knowing how to address them. This course is about how to address problems that don't fit templates you're familiar with - and how to think them through.

- Key steps:
    1. Stop looking for a formula to apply or a procedure to follow
    2. Figure out what the problem *actually* says, not the form of the problem. Focus on understanding, not doing.

## Reading assignment - What is mathematics
### More than arithmetic

- Most applied math evolved in the past 3-4 centuries, but school math curriculum is largely based on theories at least 300 years old.
- Math's origin is tied to counting money.
    - Egyptians and Babylonians added geometry and trigonometry.
    - From 500BCE to 300BCE, Greeks focused on geometry. Their exploration stopped upon encountering irrational numbers.
    - Greeks transformed math from a tool into a formal study. Thales of Miletus, around 500BCE, introduced the concept of theorems with logical proofs.
    - The rise of modern arithmetic in India during the First Millennium, complemented by the Middle Eastern exploration of algebra, propelled math further.
    - High school math today primarily features the above, plus 17th-century additions: calculus and probability.
- In the last century, math expanded from around 12 areas to over 60, leading to its modern description as the *science of patterns* (e.g., number theory for numbers, geometry for shapes).

### Mathematical notation

- Mathematicians use abstract notation due to the abstract patterns they examine; using other forms would be overly complex.
- While modern math books are filled with symbols, just as musical notes aren't the music itself, mathematical notation isn't the entirety of mathematics. A music sheet symbolises a musical piece.

### Modern college-level mathematics

- Until roughly 150 years ago, despite studying more than just numbers, mathematicians viewed math mainly as a tool for calculation. Skill in math meant being adept at calculations and symbolic manipulations.
- To ensure the reliability of mathematical discoveries, mathematicians began analysing the subject internally, shifting their focus from merely *doing* math to truly *understanding* it.

### Why are you having to learn this stuff?

- The 19th-century transition in math from computation to concept was primarily within the expert community. For many practitioners, like scientists and engineers, their mathematical approach remained largely unchanged and still does. Today's students not only use mathematical methods but also learn to prove them.
- There's a rising demand for experts who can mathematically decode and precisely analyze new challenges, like in manufacturing. Educating these experts requires a deep focus on the foundational concepts behind mathematical techniques.
