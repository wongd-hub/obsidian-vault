#regression 

- Linear regression is a very simple supervised learning method for predicting a quantitative response.
- It serves as a good jumping-off point for newer approaches since many more complex statistical learning approaches can be seen as generalisations or extensions of linear regression.
- With linear regression, we can answer the following questions:
    - Do the data provide evidence of an association between the predictor/s and the response?
    - How strong is this relationship? Does knowledge of the predictor/s provide a lot of information about the response?
    - Are all predictors associated with the response, or just a few? How do we separate out each individual predictorâ€™s association size and strength of relationship?
    - How accurately can we use the predictors to predict future response values?
    - Is the relationship linear?
    - Is there synergy between the predictors in predicting the relationship? Ie. is the combination of two predictors stronger at predicting the response than the sum of their parts ([[interaction terms]])?
