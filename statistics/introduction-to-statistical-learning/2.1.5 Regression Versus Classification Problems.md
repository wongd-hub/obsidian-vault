- Variables are either *quantitative* (numerical) or *qualitative* (categorical).
- We refer to problems with a quantitative response as *regression* problems; whereas those with qualitative responses are referred to as *classification* problems.
	- Some techniques step into both definitions such as logistic regression which estimates class probabilities (regression), but then turns these into a binary response (classification).
	- Some techniques can be used in either quantitative or qualitative situations such as [[2.2.3.2 K-Nearest Neighbours|K-nearest neighbours]] and [[boosting]].
