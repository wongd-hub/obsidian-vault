- Why would we use a more restrictive method instead of a flexible approach? There is often a trade-off between how restrictive a model is and how interpretable it is.
- If our goal is inference, then we'd likely choose a more restrictive model due to the high interpretability it allows. On the other hand, some methods are so flexible that they lead to complicated estimates of $f$ that are difficult to understand. In this case, it may be difficult to understand how any individual predictor is associated with the response. 
- However, if our goal is prediction accuracy, then we'd choose the method that provides the greatest performance over our dataset. This may not necessarily be the most flexible model type, due to the possibility that the flexibility allows the model to [[2.2.1 Measuring the Quality of Fit (Regression)#Overfitting|overfit]].
