- Estimating $f$ can be useful for both *prediction* (predicting the response for future observations - prediction accuracy is paramount here) and *inference* (better understanding the relationship between the inputs and the output - interpretability is the priority).
- There is often a [[2.1.3 The Trade-Off Between Prediction Accuracy and Model Interpretability|trade-off between prediction power and interpretability]] (e.g. more complex models may provide better predictions, but are harder to interpret)
