#textbook-intro-to-statistical-learning 

- *Supervised learning* refers to the problem set where for each observation of the predictor measurements ($x_i$, $i=1,\dots,n$) there is an associated response measurement ($y_i$). We aim to fit a model that relates the response to the predictors with either prediction or inference as the goal. ^31a009
	- Many statistical learning methods fall into this domain: linear/logistic regression, Generalised Additive Models, boosting, and support vector machines.
- *Unsupervised learning* describes the situation where for every observation ($i=1,\dots,n$), we have a vector of measurements ($x_i$) but no associated response ($y_i$). We do not have response data to supervise our analysis, which limits what we're able to achieve. ^0ebfb2
	- We can instead seek to understand the relationships between the variables or the observations using:
		- [[Cluster analysis|Cluster analysis/clustering]]: where the goal is to determine whether observations fall into distinct groups (i.e. categorising potential customers)
- There are also *semi-supervised* situations where we have responses for some of the $n$ observations, but no responses for the rest of them. This may arise if it is expensive to obtain response data. We would want to use learning methods that can incorporate the observations for which there are responses, but also the ones without responses - however this is beyond the scope of this book.
