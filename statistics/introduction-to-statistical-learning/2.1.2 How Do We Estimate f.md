- Techniques for estimating $f$ can be characterised as either *parametric* or *non-parametric*.
- *Parametric* techniques require that a functional form be assumed for the data, which provides a set of parameters that one needs to estimate using the data. i.e. it reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of estimating a set of parameters.
	- In general, fitting a more flexible parametric model involves fitting more parameters
- *Non-parametric* techniques do not make assumptions about the functional form of $f$. However, since they don't reduce the problem down to that of fitting a finite set of parameters, they require a large number of observations to obtain an accurate estimate for $f$.
