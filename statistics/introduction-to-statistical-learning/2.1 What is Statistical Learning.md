#textbook-intro-to-statistical-learning 

- For any dataset, we assume there's a relationship between $Y$ and $X = (X_1, X_2, \dots, X_p)$ which can be represented in the general form:
$$Y = f(x) + \epsilon$$
- Where $f$ is a fixed but unknown function of $X_1, \dots, X_p$, and $\epsilon$ is a random error term (independent of $X$ and mean 0). $f$ represents the systematic information that $X$ provides about $Y$, and is something we need to estimate based on observed points.
- Statistical learning refers to the set of approaches for estimating $f$
