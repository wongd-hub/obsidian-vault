**General notation**
- $n$ denotes the number of distinct data points available
- $p$ denotes the number of variables that are available for use
- Variable names are referred to with coloured monospace font

**Feature space**
- $x_{ij}$ represents the value of the $j$th variable for the $i$th observation, where $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$ and $j = 1, 2, \dots, p$
- $\textbf{X}$ denotes an $n \times p$ matrix whose $(i, j)$th element is $x_{ij}$
