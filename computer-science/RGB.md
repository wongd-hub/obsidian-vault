- This is one of the ways we can represent colours as a sequence of numbers.
- We can generate every colour of the rainbow by varying the amount of Red, Green, and Blue being displayed.
    - Each number is 1 byte (8 bits), so we have 256 steps for how much Red, Green, and Blue there is separately.
