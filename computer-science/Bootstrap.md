- [Bootstrap](getboostrap.com) is a framework that makes it easier to generate pretty looking webpages, forms, tables etc.
- We can use it by loading Bootstrap's minified CSS file in our HTML:

```HTML
<head>
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.2/dist/cssbootstrap.min.css" ...>
    <title>phonebook</title>
</head>
```

- Bootstrap implements styling for various existing tags, meaning we barely need to change our HTML to accommodate these third-party CSS styles.
- However, Bootstrap also implements new classes that you can use, e.g.:
    - `btn`, `btn-light` for pretty buttons
