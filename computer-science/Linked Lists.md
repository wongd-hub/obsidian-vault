- We can stitch things together in memory to solve more interesting problems than just [[Arrays|arrays]].
- All we really need for this is:
    - [[Structs|`struct`]]
    - `.` to access and edit elements of a `struct`
    - `*` to declare [[Memory#Pointers | pointers]] and de-reference pointers
- We can combine the simultaneous use of `.` and `*` into `->` as we'll see later.
