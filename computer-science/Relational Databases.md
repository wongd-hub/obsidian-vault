- It is common to use Comma Separated Values (CSV) to store data in separate tables. These are referred to sometimes as *flat files* given they only have a 2 dimensional structure. ^b38c8a
- Relational databases are more advanced than flat files, and instead are pieces of software running on a computer or a server holding a lot of tables that may be related to each other. 
- These can be queried with SQL.

## CRUD

- This stands for Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete. In a relational database you can really only do these four operations.

- When building a relational database, there is the concept of normalisation which in essence means ensuring no duplication of information.
- This is touched on more in [[SQL#Schema design / Normalisation]].
