- Bitmap (.bmp) files are images that implement images by using a grid of x and y co-ordinates - each of which represents a pixel.
    - Being able to manipulate bits allows you to apply 'filters' to images or mirror/rotate the image
    - We can also blur the image by looking in all directions from a given pixel
    - We can also detect edges and highlight them
