Matrices, arrays, factors, and date-times are all extensions of atomic vectors. We build these constructs by adding *attributes* on top of atomic vectors.

Attributes are name-value pairs that attach metadata to an object.
## 3.3.1 Getting and setting

- Individual attributes can be retrieved and modified using `attr()`.
- Alternatively, then can be:
    - Retrieved en masse with `attributes()`
    - Modified en masse with `structure()`

```r
a <- 1:3
attr(a, "x") <- "abcdef"
attr(a, "x")
#> [1] "abcdef"

attr(a, "y") <- 4:6
str(attributes(a))
#> List of 2
#>  $ x: chr "abcdef"
#>  $ y: int [1:3] 4 5 6

# Or equivalently
a <- structure(1:3, x = "abcdef", y = 4:6)
str(attributes(a))
#> List of 2
#>  $ x: chr "abcdef"
#>  $ y: int [1:3] 4 5 6
```

However ==attributes should generally be thought of as ephemeral==, as they are lost by most operations unless you've [[S3 object system (Chapter 13)|created your own S3 object]] (i.e. the attributes of `a` are lost when doing `a[1]` or `sum(a)`). There are only two attributes whose values are routinely preserved:

- **`names`**: a character vector giving each element a name
- **`dim`**: an integer vector, used to turn vectors into matrices and arrays
## 3.3.2 Names

There are three ways to name a vector:

```r
# When creating it: 
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

# By assigning a character vector to names()
x <- 1:3
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Inline, with setNames():
x <- setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```

And two ways to remove those names:

```r
names(x) <- NULL # or...
x <- unname(x)
```

It's best to have names that are unique and non-missing for easier subsetting, but this is not enforced by R. You can have things such as `""` or `NA_character_`.
## 3.3.3 Dimensions
