Matrices, arrays, factors, and date-times are all extensions of atomic vectors. We build these constructs by adding *attributes* on top of atomic vectors.

Attributes are name-value pairs that attach metadata to an object.
## 3.3.1 Getting and setting

- Individual attributes can be retrieved and modified using `attr()`.
- Alternatively, then can be:
    - Retrieved en masse with `attributes()`
    - Modified en masse with `structure()`

```r
a <- 1:3
attr(a, "x") <- "abcdef"
attr(a, "x")
#> [1] "abcdef"

attr(a, "y") <- 4:6
str(attributes(a))
#> List of 2
#>  $ x: chr "abcdef"
#>  $ y: int [1:3] 4 5 6

# Or equivalently
a <- structure(1:3, x = "abcdef", y = 4:6)
str(attributes(a))
#> List of 2
#>  $ x: chr "abcdef"
#>  $ y: int [1:3] 4 5 6
```

However ==attributes should generally be thought of as ephemeral==, as they are lost by most operations unless you've [[S3 object system (Chapter 13)|created your own S3 object]] (i.e. the attributes of `a` are lost when doing `a[1]` or `sum(a)`). There are only two attributes whose values are routinely preserved:

- **`names`**: a character vector giving each element a name
- **`dim`**: an integer vector, used to turn vectors into matrices and arrays
## 3.3.2 Names

There are three ways to name a vector:

```r
# When creating it: 
x <- c(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)

# By assigning a character vector to names()
x <- 1:3
names(x) <- c("a", "b", "c")

# Inline, with setNames():
x <- setNames(1:3, c("a", "b", "c"))
```

And two ways to remove those names:

```r
names(x) <- NULL # or...
x <- unname(x)
```

It's best to have names that are unique and non-missing for easier subsetting, but this is not enforced by R. You can have things such as `""` or `NA_character_`.
## 3.3.3 Dimensions

Adding a `dim` attribute to an atomic vector will turn it in to a 2D matrix or a multi-dimensional array. Use `matrix()`, `array()` or assign to the `dim()` attribute to create a matrix or an array.

```r
# Convention is rows, then columns, then next dimension etc.

# You can modify an object in place by setting dim()
#  NB: A 1D atomic vector actually has NULL dimensions
z <- 1:6
dim(z) <- c(3, 2) # 3 rows, 2 cols

# Two scalar arguments specify row and column sizes
x <- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)

# One vector argument to describe all dimensions
#  Rows, columns, then the next dimension, etc.
y <- array(1:12, c(2, 3, 2))
y
#> , , 1
#> 
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    1    3    5
#> [2,]    2    4    6
#> 
#> , , 2
#> 
#>      [,1] [,2] [,3]
#> [1,]    7    9   11
#> [2,]    8   10   12

# Use `str()` or `dim()` to check dimensions
str(1:3)                   # 1d vector
#>  int [1:3] 1 2 3
str(matrix(1:3, ncol = 1)) # column vector
#>  int [1:3, 1] 1 2 3
```

Many functions for working with vectors also have generalisations that work with matrices and arrays.
