Vectors are the most important family of data types in base R. This chapter will go through how all the types fit together as a whole.

Vectors come in two flavours: atomic vectors and lists. they differ in terms of their element's types.
- In atomic vectors, all elements must have the same type
- For lists, elements can have different types

`NULL` is closely related to vectors and often serves the role of a generic zero length vector. It is, however, not a vector.

Every vector can have *attributes*, which can be thought of as a named list of arbitrary metadata. Two attributes are particularly important:
- The *dimension* attribute, which turns vectors into matrices and arrays. We'll learn by R considers these 2D structures to be vectors.
- The *class* attribute, which powers the [[S3 object system (Chapter 13)]]

We'll revisit S3 in Chapter 13, but here we'll discuss some of the most important S3 vectors: factors, date and times, data frames, and tibbles.
