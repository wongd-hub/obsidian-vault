The four primary types of atomic vectors are:
- Logical
- Integer
- Double
- Character

There are two rarer types, complex (as in complex numbers) and raw (binary data). We won't discuss them since we will rarely ever use them.

## 3.2.1 Scalars

Each type of vector has special syntax for creating a single value:

- Logical: `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `T`, `F`
- Integer: Same as double, but must be followed by an `L`, e.g. `4L` (this comes from the long integer type in C)
- Double: `0.1234`, `1.23e4` (scientific), `0xcafe` (hexadecimal), `Inf`/`-Inf`/`NaN`
- Character: Strings surrounded by `"` or `'`, special characters escaped with `\`

## 3.2.2 Making longer vectors with `c()`

Create longer vectors by putting shorter ones into `c()`. Note that `c()` automatically *flattens* its inputs. You can determine the length or type of a vector with `length()` and `typeof()`. 

```r
c(c(1, 2), c(3, 4))
#> [1] 1 2 3 4
```

## 3.2.3 Missing values

R represents missing values as `NA`, these tend to be infectious so most computations involving a missing value will return another missing value. The only case where this doesn't apply is when the computation is an identity that holds for all possible inputs.

This also means that things like `x == NA` will always return `NA`. Use `is.na()` to check for missing-ness instead.

```r
NA > 5
#> [1] NA
!NA
#> [1] NA

NA ^ 0
#> [1] 1
NA | TRUE
#> [1] TRUE
```

There are technically four different types of `NA`: `NA` (logical), `NA_integer_` (integer), `NA_real_` (double), and `NA_character_` (character).

## 3.2.4 Testing and coercion

You can test if a vector is of a given type using `is.logical()`, `is.integer()`, `is.double()`, and `is.character()`. Avoid `is.numeric()`, `is.atomic()`, and `is.vector()` since they don't do what you'd expect them to do - check the documentation to find out more.

For atomic vectors, all elements must be the same type (type is a property of the *entire* vector). If you try to combine multiple types of values, they'll be coerced to the lowest common denominator: 

> logical < integer < double < character

Coercion will generally happen automatically, most mathematical functions will coerce to numeric (`TRUE` will coerce to 1, `FALSE` to 0). You can deliberately coerce with `as.*()`.

```r
str(c('a', 1))
#> chr [1:2] "a" "1"
```
