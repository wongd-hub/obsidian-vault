The four primary types of atomic vectors are:
- Logical
- Integer
- Double
- Character

There are two rarer types, complex (as in complex numbers) and raw (binary data). We won't discuss them since we will rarely ever use them.

## 3.2.1 Scalars

Each type of vector has special syntax for creating a single value:

- Logical: `TRUE`, `FALSE` or `T`, `F`
- Integer: Same as double, but must be followed by an `L`, e.g. `4L` (this comes from the long integer type in C)
- Double: `0.1234`, `1.23e4` (scientific), `0xcafe` (hexadecimal), `Inf`/`-Inf`/`NaN`
- Character: Strings surrounded by `"` or `'`, special characters escaped with `\`
