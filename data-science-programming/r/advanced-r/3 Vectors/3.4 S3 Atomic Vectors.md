Another important attribute that vectors can have (in addition to `names` and `dim`) is `class`. If a vector has a `class` attribute then it becomes an *S3 object*; which in turn means that it will behave differently when passed through a generic function. 

Every S3 object is built on top of a base type and usually stores further information in more attributes. Four of the most widely used S3 objects are:

- Categorical data, where values come from a fixed set of levels recorded in factor levels
- Dates (at the day level) recorded in Date vectors
- Date-times (at the second/sub-second level) recorded in POSIXct vectors
- Durations, stored in difftime vectors

## 3.4.1 Factors

Factors can only contain predefined values. They're built on top of integer vectors with two additional attributes:

- `class` of `'factor'`
- `levels`: a vector that contains the levels of the factor

Ordered factors are a minor variation on factors, where the order of the levels is meaningful.

```r
x <- factor(c("a", "b", "b", "a"))
x
#> [1] a b b a
#> Levels: a b

typeof(x)
#> [1] 'integer'
```

```r
grade <- ordered(c("b", "b", "a", "c"), levels = c("c", "b", "a"))
grade
#> [1] b b a c
#> Levels: c < b < a
```

Some further points about factors:
- Factors are useful when you know the entire set of possible values for a variable and they may not all be present in a particular dataset. 
    - When you tabulate a factor (using `table()`), you'll get counts of all possible levels, including those that are missing from the data.
- Factors tend to be encountered frequently in base R since `read.csv()` and `data.frame()` convert strings to factors automatically. This is suboptimal since the functions have no way of knowing the set of all possible values or their correct order. It is better for you to handle this yourself.
- Factors look like character vectors but are actually built on top of integer ones, so if you want to operate over the factor name values, it's better to explicitly convert them to characters first.

## 3.4.2 Dates

Date vectors are built on top of double vectors and have a `class` of `'Date'` and no other attributes. The value of a double (which can be seen by stripping away the class) is the number of days since 1970-01-01.

```r
today <- Sys.Date()

typeof(today)
#> [1] "double"
attributes(today)
#> $class
#> [1] "Date"

unclass(as.Date("1970-02-01"))
#> [1] 31
```

## 3.4.3 Date-times

Base R provides two ways of storing date-times:
- **POSIXlt**: Portable Operating System Interface - local time
- **POSIXct**: Portable Operating System Interface - calendar time
    - We'll focus on this one since it's the simplest and is the most appropriate for use in data frames.

POSIXct vectors are built on top of double vectors, where the value represents the number of seconds since 1970-01-01.
- It has a `tzone` attribute which doesn't affect the instant of time represented by the vector, only how its printed.
- If a date-time is at midnight then the time is not printed.

```r
now_ct <- as.POSIXct("2018-08-01 22:00", tz = "UTC")
now_ct
#> [1] "2018-08-01 22:00:00 UTC"

typeof(now_ct)
#> [1] "double"
attributes(now_ct)
#> $class
#> [1] "POSIXct" "POSIXt" 
#> 
#> $tzone
#> [1] "UTC"

structure(now_ct, tzone = "America/New_York")
#> [1] "2018-08-01 18:00:00 EDT"
structure(now_ct, tzone = "Australia/Lord_Howe")
#> [1] "2018-08-02 08:30:00 +1030"
```

## 3.4.4 Durations

Durations represent the time between two dates or date-times and are stored in difftimes. Difftimes are built on top of doubles and have a `units` attribute which determines how the value should be interpreted.

```r
one_week_1 <- as.difftime(1, units = "weeks")
one_week_1
#> Time difference of 1 weeks

typeof(one_week_1)
#> [1] "double"
attributes(one_week_1)
#> $class
#> [1] "difftime"
#> 
#> $units
#> [1] "weeks"
```
