#textbook_advanced-r #r 

The following code creates a vector and binds `x` and `y` names to that object. It then modifies `y`.

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
y <- x

y[[3]] <- 4
x
#> [1] 1 2 3
```

Modifying `y` didn't change `x`, so what happened to the shared object address?

- The value associated with `y` changed. R created a new object to associate with `y` - a copy of `x` with one value changed. i.e. The copy only occurred when `y` was modified (*copy-on-modify*).
- R objects are generally *immutable* (with a few [[important exceptions, including rules that lead to modify-in-place behaviour]]).

## 2.3.1 `tracemem()`

A useful tool for seeing how an object gets copied is by running `tracemem()` on the object. This will print a message telling you when the object was copied, its new address, and the sequence of calls that led to the copy.

```r
x <- c(1, 2, 3)
cat(tracemem(x), '\n') 
#> <0x7feb7bfeaf98> 

y <- x
y[[3]] <- 4L
#> tracemem[0x7feb7bfeaf98 -> 0x7feb7bfb13f8]: 

# Turn memory tracing off
untracemem(x)
```

Note that if we modify `y` again, there won't be another copy. The new object that `y` is bound to will just get updated instead. This is because there is only one name bound to this object, so R applies [[modify-in-place optimisation]].

## 2.3.2 Function calls

The same rules for copying also apply to function calls. The following code creates a function that calls the object passed as an argument and assigns it to the variable name we provide using arrow assignment.

```r
f <- function(a) {
  a
}

x <- c(1, 2, 3)
cat(tracemem(x), "\n")
#> <0x7feb7e83c858> 

z <- f(x)
# No copy here
```

While `f()` is running, the `a` points to the same value as the `x` does outside the function. Since it points to the same object with no modifications, the behaviour is the same as at the start of this page - i.e. `z` now points to the same value as `x` does.

If `f()` did modify `x`, then R would create a new modified copy and bind that to `z`

## 2.3.3 Lists

It's not just names that point to variables, elements of lists do as well.

```r
l1 <- list(1, 2, 3)
l2 <- l1
```

Instead of storing the values (1, 2, 3), the list stores *references* to them. When we copy the list, we're making a *shallow* copy; i.e. the list object and its bindings are copied, but the values pointed to by the bindings are not.

When we modify a list, only the modified items have their bindings changed

```r
l2[[3]] <- 4
```

To see the values shared across lists, use `lobstr::ref()` which prints the memory address of each object along with a local ID so you can easily cross-reference shared components.

```r
> lobstr::ref(l1, l2)
#> █ [1:0x7feb7bc31858] <list> 
#> ├─[2:0x7feb7914d270] <dbl> 
#> ├─[3:0x7feb7914d238] <dbl> 
#> └─[4:0x7feb7914d200] <dbl> 
#>  
#> █ [5:0x7feb69e430d8] <list> 
#> ├─[2:0x7feb7914d270] 
#> ├─[3:0x7feb7914d238] 
#> └─[6:0x7feb7ef98500] <dbl> 
```

## 2.3.4 Data-frames

Data frames are just lists of vectors, so the concepts in [[#2.3.3 Lists]] are easily extensible to this case.

When you modify a column, only that column needs to be modified; the others will still point to their original references.

```r
d1 <- data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 6), y = c(2, 4, 3))
d2 <- d1
d2[, 2] <- d2[, 2] * 2
```

But if you modify a row, you're changing values across every column, so all columns will be copied

```r
d3 <- d1
d3[1, ] <- d3[1, ] * 3
```

## 2.3.5 Character vectors

The final place where R uses references is in character vectors. How character vectors actually work is that there is a *global string pool*, and each element of a character vector points to a unique string in the pool. You can request the reference of each string in the pool using `lobstr::ref(., character = TRUE)`.

```r
x <- c("a", "a", "abc", "d")
lobstr::ref(x, character = TRUE)
#> █ [1:0x7feb79c75b78] <chr> 
#> ├─[2:0x7fec002d8fc8] <string: "a"> 
#> ├─[2:0x7fec002d8fc8] 
#> ├─[3:0x7febca7dda88] <string: "abc"> 
#> └─[4:0x7fec003c6e70] <string: "d"> 
```
