You can find how much memory an object takes with `lobstr::obj_size()`.
- Elements of lists are just references to values to the following list won't be as large as you might think. It's only 80 B larger, and 80 B is the size of an empty list with three NULL elements.
  - Due to this, `obj_size(x) + obj_size(y)` will only equal `obj_size(x, y)` if there are no shared values (see code block below for what `x` and `y` are)
- Similarly, because of R's global string pool. Repeating a string 100 times will not take up 100 times as much memory.

```r
# Normal example
obj_size(letters)
#> 1,712 B
obj_size(ggplot2::diamonds)
#> 3,456,344 B

# List example
x <- runif(1e6)
obj_size(x)
#> 8,000,048 B

y <- list(x, x, x)
obj_size(y)
#> 8,000,128 B

# Character vector example
banana <- "bananas bananas bananas"
obj_size(banana)
#> 136 B
obj_size(rep(banana, 100))
#> 928 B
```

R 3.5.0+ have a feature called ALTREP (*alternative representation*) which allows R to represent certain vectors very compactly. 
- A common example of this is when using `:` to create an integer range. Instead of storing every number in the sequence, R just stores the start and end values. This means that every sequence, no matter how large, is the same size

```r
obj_size(1:3)
#> 680 B
obj_size(1:1e3)
#> 680 B
obj_size(1:1e6)
#> 680 B
obj_size(1:1e9)
#> 680 B
```
