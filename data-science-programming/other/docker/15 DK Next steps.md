- There are more, albeit less used Docker commands to learn. 
    - `ENTRYPOINT`, `HEALTHCHECK`, `EXPOSE`

- We can also learn how to create a new image from scratch, or how to create multi-stage builds allowing you to create images built off multiple Docker images at once.

- We also didn't touch on networking or volumes, allowing you to expose/connect your containers to a network and to access local or saved files.

- There are also several tools like Kubernetes (allowing you to programatically start/stop containers and much more) and docker-compose (allowing multi-container interactions) that allow you to orchestrate Docker containers.
