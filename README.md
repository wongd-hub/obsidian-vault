TODO:
- This vault has been published using Quartz to https://wongd-hub.github.io/obsidian-quartz. However there are some issues:
    - Using `rsync` to copy files over from one repo to another upon push to this repo. This might be modifying certain symbols causing LaTeX to break (e.g. \f -> FF). Need to fix.
    - Need a better way to traverse the notes; add more Map of Contents
